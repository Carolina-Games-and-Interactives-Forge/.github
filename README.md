# Carolina Games and Interactives Forge (CGIF)

The Carolina Games and Interactives Forge (CGIF) is more than just an organisation â€“ it's a thriving community dedicated to forging the talents of game designers and developers at the University of South Carolina! At CGIF, our mission is to cultivate the craft of game-making while sharing our passion and knowledge with enthusiasts far and wide. 

Within our forge, we delve deep into the concepts of game development, from the realms of storytelling to the art of character design and level building. Here, we harness the power of open-source and commercial game and asset development technologies to create really awesome games, while upholding the highest industry standards. Our goal is to develop exceptional games that inspire others to embark on their creative journeys. Our creations go beyond mere entertainment; through "Serious Games," we aim to educate, train, rehabilitate, and explore serious topics.

But our reach extends beyond the forge's walls. Through talks, presentations, demonstrations, and game jams, we champion the art of game development, showcasing our latest creations and offering invaluable insights into the tools of the trade. Furthermore, we actively engage with our community by volunteering with local high schools, middle schools, and youth groups, igniting the spark of creativity in the minds of future game development apprentices.

All majors and talents are welcome; we only ask that you bring your creativity, passion, and a laptop.
